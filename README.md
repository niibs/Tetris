# Prison Tetris 
A CMSC 21 Final Project 
##OVERVIEW
Our game is called “Prison Tetris,” it is based on the 1980s arcade classic game of Tetris. The
object of the game is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks.
And similar to the classic game of tetris, lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and
have no empty spaces. But to make things interesting, this will be a story-based game.
One day, Prisoner A finds themself trapped in a prison cell with tetriminos falling from above. In
order to get Prisoner A out of the cell, the player must first keep the prisoner alive within the
2-minute interval. To do this, the player must make sure that the tetriminos do not fall directly on
the prisoner, and that the piling blocks do not reach the top of the playing field. If the player
manages to complete the level, the time bomb will explode and create an opening on one side of
the playing field and the prisoner gets to successfully escape.
